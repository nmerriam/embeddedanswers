<h5>Inspiration</h5>

<p><a href="https://rickbeato.com/">Rick Beato</a> and
<a href="https://scottsbasslessons.com/">Scott Devine</a> both
struggled to get into music school. Now they have, in their own very different ways,
created an enormous wealth of freely available information, in part to help
people who cannot get access to music school.</p>

<p>With Embedded Answers, I would like to make some of the information
that you might get in a good computer science degree available to people who
cannot easily get to college. Or they went to college and this material was
not covered.</p>

<h5>Richard Bird</h5>

<a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/richard.bird/">Richard Bird</a>
gave a seminar in the mid 90s, together with research collaborator Ooge de Moor.
It changed, forever, my understaning of high-performance computing.
The academic view of computer performance (that I am steriotyping, here) is that
only the algorithm matters. It is true that no amount of hacking around with
assembly code will make the wrong algorithm perform well, and that the
algorithm choice is vital for large data sets.</p>

<p>Richard Bird was the
first academic, in my experience, who came out and said that
you need both. Once you have the right algorithm, you can still double the
performance with low-level optimization. And doubling the performance matters.</p>

<p>I have since coined the terms <em>macro-</em>optimization for choice of
algorithm and data-structures and <em>micro-</em>optimization for tuning at the
instruction level. It is not a perfect classification, but I find it helpful
to have a way to know which kind of optimization we are thinking about.</p>
